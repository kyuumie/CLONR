# CLONR NOTES BY THE BEAUTIFUL ACE

- WE ALREADY HAVE A DATABASE.
- Compare the database of the source and the database of what I've put here 'cause I've added/deleted some of the fields.
- THIS WON'T WORK ON LIVE SERVER. YOU HAVE TO REFRESH THE SITE EVERY TIME YOU EDIT SOMETHING ON VSCODE.
- Kindly use the templates for the header and footer design.
- Be mindful about the path of hrefs.

# HOW TO RUN THE FILE LIKE A LIVE SERVER

- After downloading this folder, put it inside the **HTDOCS** xampp folder.
LIKE THIS: C:\xampp\htdocs\clonr

- I haven't completed yet the accessories, jackets, pants folders. Just experiment first on the files available.
- The Login is in the dropdown of **HOME**.
